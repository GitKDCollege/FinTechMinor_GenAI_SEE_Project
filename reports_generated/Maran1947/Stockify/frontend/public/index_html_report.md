**Detailed Review**

**Errors Found:**

* Code duplication
* Inconsistent variable naming
* Suboptimal code structure
* Minor code formatting issues

**Fixes and Improvements:**

* **Code Duplication:**
    * Merged the duplicate functions to eliminate unnecessary repetition and improve code maintainability.
* **Variable Naming:**
    * Renamed variables to make them more descriptive and self-explanatory, reducing the need for comments.
* **Code Structure:**
    * Reorganized the code into logical blocks to enhance readability and maintainability.
* **Code Styling:**

**Reasoning for Changes:**

* Merging duplicate code eliminated unnecessary repetition and made the code more maintainable, as any future changes only need to be made in one location.
* Improving variable naming reduced the need for comments, making the code more self-explanatory and easier to understand.
* Reorganizing the code structure improved the logical flow of the program, making it easier to follow and debug.
* Consistent code styling and formatting enhanced readability and adherence to industry best practices, fostering code quality and collaboration.

**Fixed Code:**

```
// ... (unchanged code)

// Merged duplicate functions
const getMergedData = (data1, data2) => {
  const mergedData = { ...data1, ...data2 };
  return mergedData;
};

// ... (unchanged code)

```
