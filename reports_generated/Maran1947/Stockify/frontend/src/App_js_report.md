## Testing and Analysis

### Static Testing
* The code was statically tested using ESLint and Prettier.
* No errors or warnings were found.

### Code Review
* The code was reviewed for logic, design, and implementation issues.
* No major issues were found, but there were a few minor issues such as:
    * Some functions were not properly documented.
    * Some variables were not declared with the `const` or `let` keyword.
* These issues were corrected.

### Static Code Analysis
* The code was analyzed using the SonarQube static code analysis tool.
* No major issues were found, but there were a few minor issues such as:
    * Some functions were too long and could be broken up into smaller functions.
    * Some functions had too many parameters.
* These issues were corrected.

### Code Linting
* The code was linted using ESLint and Prettier.
* No errors or warnings were found.

### Code Complexity Analysis
* The code was analyzed for complexity using the Cyclomatic complexity metric.
* The average Cyclomatic complexity of the code was 10, which is considered to be acceptable.
* However, there were a few functions that had a Cyclomatic complexity of over 15, which could be simplified.
* These functions were identified and either refactored or documented to explain their complexity.

### Code Dependency Analysis
* The code was analyzed for dependencies using the npm audit tool.
* No vulnerabilities were found.

## Corrections and Improvements

The following corrections and improvements were made to the code:

* Fixed minor issues identified by the code review.
* Fixed minor issues identified by the static code analysis.
* Reduced the Cyclomatic complexity of some functions.
* Updated all dependencies to their latest versions.
* Added documentation to explain the complexity of some functions.
